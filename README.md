Hello! Welcome to the FSU short course on Machine Learning and Causal Inference. We will be working from an overleaf available [(here)](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dhrpjympcfkm).

If you have R and RStudio installed on your computer, you're just about good to go.  Make sure that you have the pacakges `cli`, `grf`,`ranger`, and `devtools` installed from CRAN.  You will also need the `PLCE` package from my github, which can be downloaded `devtools::install_github('ratkovic/PLCE')`. 

Finally, with those in place, install this package using  `devtools::install_github('ratkovic/FSU)`. 

With all of the packages in, run `FSU::get_handout(1)` and then follow the instructions.

The structure of this package comes from work done by Will Lowe, so thank him when you see him.
